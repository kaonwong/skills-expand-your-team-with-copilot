# GitHub Issue Templates for Teachers

This repository now includes structured issue templates to help teachers easily request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system. These templates ensure that all necessary information is provided for our Copilot coding agent to implement changes efficiently.

## Available Issue Templates

When creating a new issue, you'll see these template options:

### üöÄ Feature Request

- Examples: Add difficulty levels, create new filters, implement calendar view
- **Provides:** Structured fields for problem description, acceptance criteria, implementation hints
- **Result:** Clear requirements for Copilot to implement new features

### üé® UI/UX Enhancement  
**Use when:** You want to change the visual design or user interface
- Examples: Update school colors, add mascots, improve mobile layout, change fonts
- **Provides:** Visual specifications, brand requirements, accessibility considerations
- **Result:** Detailed design brief for Copilot to implement visual changes

### üêõ Bug Report
**Use when:** Something is broken or not working correctly
- Examples: Students can't register, login problems, display issues
- **Provides:** Step-by-step reproduction, debugging information, technical details
- **Result:** Complete diagnostic information for Copilot to identify and fix issues

### üè´ Activity Management
**Use when:** You need to add, modify, or remove school activities
- Examples: Add new robotics club, change chess club schedule, remove cancelled activities
- **Provides:** Complete activity details, scheduling information, participant management
- **Result:** Precise instructions for Copilot to manage activity data

### üìù Content Update
**Use when:** Text, descriptions, or documentation needs updating
- Examples: Fix typos, update activity descriptions, change contact information
- **Provides:** Exact current text, exact new text, location details
- **Result:** Clear content changes for Copilot to implement accurately

## How to Use the Templates

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in this GitHub repository
2. **Click "New Issue"** - you'll see the template options
3. **Choose the appropriate template** based on your request type
4. **Fill out all required fields** - the templates guide you through what information is needed
5. **Submit the issue** - Copilot coding agent will receive a complete, actionable request

## Why Use These Templates?

### For Teachers:
- ‚úÖ **No technical knowledge required** - templates ask for information in plain language
- ‚úÖ **Guided process** - forms tell you exactly what information to provide
- ‚úÖ **Faster implementation** - complete information means quicker turnaround
- ‚úÖ **Better results** - structured requirements lead to more accurate implementations

### For Copilot Coding Agent:
- ‚úÖ **Complete requirements** - all necessary information provided upfront
- ‚úÖ **Clear acceptance criteria** - knows exactly what "done" looks like
- ‚úÖ **Implementation guidance** - hints about technical approach and files to modify
- ‚úÖ **Context and constraints** - understands priority, scope, and limitations

## Template Structure

Each template includes these essential components (as requested in the original issue):

### ‚úÖ Clear Problem Description
- What issue needs to be solved
- Who is affected and how
- Background context and user stories

### ‚úÖ Clear Acceptance Criteria  
- Specific, testable requirements
- Definition of "done"
- Quality standards and verification steps

### ‚úÖ Hints, Tips, and Suggested Solutions
- Technical implementation guidance
- File locations and code areas to modify
- Suggested approaches and tools

### ‚úÖ Limitations, Related Information, and Context
- Priority and urgency levels
- Scope and impact assessment
- Dependencies and constraints
- Additional background information

## Example: Before vs After

### Before (typical unclear issue):
> "The website looks bad and students don't like the colors. Can you fix it?"

### After (using UI/UX Enhancement template):
> **UI/UX Enhancement Summary:** Update school colors from blue to white and lime green theme
> 
> **Current Design Issue:** The website currently uses blue colors, but our school colors are white and lime green. This doesn't represent our school identity properly and students/parents expect to see our actual school colors.
>
> **Desired Design:** 
> - Primary color: Lime green (#32CD32)
> - Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF)
> - Header should be lime green background with white text
> - Activity cards should have white background with lime green borders
> - Add school mascot from https://octodex.github.com/
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> - [ ] Header background changed to lime green (#32CD32)
> - [ ] All buttons use lime green background with white text
> - [ ] Design maintains accessibility standards
> - [ ] All existing functionality continues to work unchanged

## Getting Help

- üìö **Documentation:** Check our [Development Guide](../docs/how-to-develop.md) for technical details
- üí¨ **Discussions:** Join community discussions for questions and ideas
- ‚ùì **Unclear Requirements:** Use the most similar template and add details in "Additional Context"

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific:** The more detailed your request, the better the implementation
2. **Use Examples:** Reference other websites or systems when helpful
3. **Think About Users:** Consider how changes affect teachers, students, and parents
4. **Test Ideas:** If unsure, describe what you want to achieve and ask for suggestions
5. **Follow Up:** Check the implemented solution and provide feedback
